## Current Scope

A basic, trivial, simple, minimal, walking skeleton, POC, bleeding-edge demo for Habit Tracker App implementing JWT Auth & CRUD operations as `Microservices Arch` in `Node.js`, deployed on K8S, having the following functionalities:
* `Register`, `Login`, as a User!
* User can Add new `Habit`.
* Update an existing `Habit`.
* Delete an existing `Habit`.
* View `Habit` information.
* List all `Habits`.

## Project Status

This project is currently under development (Immature, subject to break, evolve, change, emits loud noise when running!!). Users now can do the above functionalities, As per requirements of the assignment with the former disclaimer üëà IN MIND!!!

## Installation and Setup Instructions

You need the following requirements installed globally on your machine.

## Requirements
- Docker Desktop 4.28.0 (139021) is currently the newest version available.
- Enabled Kubernetes Cluster over Docker Desktop.
Or the environment of your choice to have K8s && Docker up & running as per your OS.

### Getting The Codebase:

The simplest way to obtain the code is using the github .zip feature. Click [here](https://github.com/ahmadSaeedGoda/nodejs_habit_tracking_app/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) to get the latest stable version as a .zip compressed file.

The recommended way is using `GIT`. You'll need to make sure `git version ~2.34.1` is installed on your machine. Use a terminal or Power Shell to visit the directory where you'd like to have the source code placed, then type in:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/ahmadSaeedGoda/nodejs_habit_tracking_app.git
```
Feel free to switch the URL to use `SSH` protocol instead!

### Installation and Configuration:
- <b>Step 1:</b> Get the code. "As explained [above](#getting-the-codebase)".

- <b>Step 2:</b> Set the Environment Variables.<br>
Go through the `src` dir, Find any file named `.env.*.example` in the root directory of each service. Duplicate the file in the same path/location, then rename the new one `.env` then set the values of the environment variables listed within the file according to your environment respectively.

Replicate the same step for `docker-compose.yml.example`, `Dockerfile.dev.example`, `Dockerfile.postgres.example`. Just remove the suffix `.example` after duplicating these files and you're good to go!

- <b>Step 3:</b> Visit the path `<project-root>/src/services/auth/` and issue API keys/certs using the respective tool of your choice! The key should be named `<project-root>/src/services/auth/certs/public.pem` & `<project-root>/src/services/auth/certs/private.pem` respectively, and should reside in the specified path.

Note: If you are on Linux Ubuntu, the openssl is a pre-installed utility.

- <b>Step 4:</b> Navigate to the root directory of the project you cloned or downloaded via CLI, then run the following command to get it up and running!
```sh
$ docker compose up
```
or:

```sh
$ npm run dev
```

Easy peasy lemon squeezy, my friend! That's how we roll and spin things up.<br>
Voila! Just like that, but with more pizza and coffee!

<b><span style="background-color:yellow; color:black">Note:</span></b> `docker compose up` in the console after making sure the prompt points to the root directory of the project. So that you can have an up & running <strong><span style="background-color:white; color:blue">dev server</strong></span> on the default ports specified within the file with `nodemon` for Auto-Restart/Hot-Reload whenever you make any modifications to the code and save the files.

><span style="color:lightgreen">Specify the file named `Dockerfile.staging.uat.example` after duplicating it & removal of `.example` suffix in your `docker-compose.yml`.
This way, when running the file in the console after making sure the prompt points to the root directory of the project you can have a production similar running server for testing purposes!
</span>

<br>

Whatever convenient for you to run the app for visiting the endpoints in an API client such as `postman`, `insomnia` or even `curl`.


- <b>Step 5: Deploy on K8s</b>
Navigate to the project <root-dir> via CLI to run the following commands in-order:

```sh
$ kubectl apply -f k8s/ld-namespace.yaml
```
So you create a namespace specified for our resources to live and play around isolated, to avoid cluttering others work. üòâ

```sh
$ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/controller-v1.10.0/deploy/static/provider/cloud/deploy.yaml
```
So you can have ingress added to your current setup since it's not an in built feature of K8s.

```sh
$ kubectl apply -f k8s/ingress.yaml
```
So you configure the applied ingress controller to work with our env specific configurations. ü§û

```sh
$ kubectl apply -f k8s/
```
So you create all the needed resources for the project to run in the cluster using the files definitions. ‚úåÔ∏è

```sh
$ cat ./hosts | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```
So you append the services URLs/domain-names to the `/etc/hosts` file on your local host machine for the mapping to get executed and for you to stay relaxed from figuring out each & every port for every service running! üòé

<br><b><span style="background-color:yellow; color:black">Note:</span></b> A shared Postman collection && Environment Variables are included/shared within the source code root directory, this can be imported and ready to use after changing the environment variables values as per your local env. "In case you'd like to change the default"

For documentation & Usage see `Postman Collection` shared collection with Examples included in file: `Nodejs Habit Tracker Micro K8s.postman_collection.json`.

Import the above file in `Insomnia` or `Postman` or any other client!

Now you can Register & Login, Create new `Habit`, then once a new one is created via the available endpoint .. Update an existing one, Deleting an existing one, Get a specified `Habit`, or Get all `Habits` for the authenticated user can be achieved.
